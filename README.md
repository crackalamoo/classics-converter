An online tool using Latin and Sanskrit to predict words in their modern descendent languages.
Rather than translating between languages, this tool relies on phonological changes
that linguists have pieced together in order to predict a word in one language
from another. Hosted at [harysdalvi.com/classics-converter](https://www.harysdalvi.com/classics-converter).

For example, the Latin word "oculum" evolved into Spanish "ojo". This tool
can predict that and more.

But it's not perfect: it doesn't capture phonological changes, and a lot of language evolution can't be described fully by these simple rules. Please feel free to contribute to help make this a really useful tool for studying historical phonology!
